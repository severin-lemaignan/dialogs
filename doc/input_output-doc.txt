Our data structure consists on classes arranged in a tree; this facilitates searching and retrieving information.
Since we deal with sentences containing several aftershocks following, we opted for the use of lists. Therefore, the data to be transmitted between the different modules will be a list of several classes Sentence. 
A sentence is formed from:
    sn : a nominal structure typed into a Nominal_group
    sv : a verbal structure typed into a VerbalGroup
    aim : is used for retrieveing the aim of a question
    data_type: is the type of the sentence

Nominal group class declaration
    det : determinant
    noun: a simple noun
    adj: a list of adjectives describing the noun
    noun_cmpl: a list of noun complements which is a nominal_group
    relative: is a relative sentence typed into Sentence
We can have also when the group is resolved an id which must be different from None
self.id = None
This field is True when this nominal group is resolved to a concept known by the robot.
     self._resolved = False
Also:
self._conjunction = 'AND' #could be 'AND' or 'OR'... 
     self._quantifier = 'ONE' #could be 'ONE' or 'SOME'...
An indirect complement or adverbial is formed from:
    Indirect complement class declaration
    gn : nominal group
    prep : preposition
   
Verbal_group class declaration
    vrb_main: the main verb of a sentence
    vrb_sec : an accompanying verb of the main verb
    vrb_tense: the main verb tense
    d_obj : the  direct object referred by the main verb
    i_cmpl : the indirect object referred by the main verb or an adverbial formed from a nominal group
    vrb_adv : an adverb describing the verb
    advrb : an adverb used as an adverbial of the whole sentence
   



=== Input/Output system ===

 * Global functionnality
This module calls a chain of external functions to apply the rules of grammar to the sentence as a list of words.  The determination of nominal group is through this determinant, the personal pronoun or uppercase.
Example:
I play guitar ? Here, there is a mistake because "guitar" is not preceded by a determinant
I play a guitar ? OK
For every nominal group, we have derived information such as supplements or on behalf of.
After that, it is necessary to remember the path of a sentence (for parsing or verbalization). So for a question, we have an inversion of subject and an imperative sentence, the subject is absent.


 * is
In preprocessing, all "'s" linked to a personal pronoun or a few proposals as "what" and "that" may not represent a relationship of possession but the verb state "is". So after this condition, change will be made or not.
Utterance: "It's on the table."
	"It is on the table." 

In the opposite way, this processing will still be done. To have an output with "is" preceded by a pronoun.


Extension of contractions
It is making some changes that would eliminate a word to be replaced by other one or modify and add some others.
Utterance: "I wanna play with my guitar. I'd like to go to the cinema."
	"I want to play with my guitar. I would like to go to the cinema."

In verbalization, this transformation does not include cases of "wanna" et "gonna". Otherwise all the others are still executed.


 * Possession
In preprocessing, we are processing "'s". Indeed, there is a relationship of possession that can be translated by the use of "of". We therefore must find the noun before and after "'s". Knowing that the noun after is not preceded by a determinant, it is necessary to add. We have therefore chosen the determinant "the" because the object is known.
Utterance: "Jido's blue bottle is on the table". 
	"The blue bottle of Jido is on the table." 

In the opposite direction when we have a relationship of possession that can be translated by "of", we proceed to change automatically. It is impossible to have an output with "of" between nominal groups.

This processing can be done cascade which allows us to have two or more ownership.
Utterance: "You shouldn't drive his poorest uncle's wife's big new car." 
	"You shouldn't drive the big new car of the wife of his poorest uncle."

If we have a plural noun, the "'s" no longer maintained, in its place we have "s'".
Example: the boys' ball is blue.


 * Inversion of preposition
Some prepositions follow the noun, It is therefore put forward.
Utterance: "I played a guitar a year ago."
	"I played a guitar ago a year."

In the opposite way, this transformation has been implemented.


 * Comma
In preprocessing, a comma between two nominal groups can become "and" if and only if collecting all nouns after the last will be preceded by "and". 
Utterance1: "I'll play a guitar, a piano and a violon."
	"I'll play a guitar and a piano and a violon."
Utterance2: "I will play a guitar, when the man is here."
	There is no change because the comma is not followed by a nominal group.

With a combination of relations of possession and commas, we can process:
Utterance3: "I'll play Jido's guitar, a saxophone, a piano of the wife of my oncle and Patrick's violon."
	"I'll play the guitar of Jido and a saxophone and a piano of the wife of my oncle and the violon of Patrick."

In verbalization, while the component with more than two elements in their list the first will be separated by commas and the last two by a "and". We will have all time: "I'll play a guitar, a piano and a violon."


 * Negation
In preprocessing, all "n't" will be replaced by "not"
Utterance: "don't give me the bottle."
	"do not give me the bottle."

There is an exception, for "won't" should be processed as for the extension contractions effect: 
Utterance: "When won't the planning session take place?"
	"When will not the planning session take place?"

In the opposite way, this transformation has been implemented.


 * Tense
All times are implemented in the parsing and the verbalization.
Present simple 
	For singular "s"
Present perfect
	"has" or "have"+ past participal
Present progressive
	"is" or "are" or "am" + verb + "ing"
Present passive
	"is" or "are" or "am" + past participal
Present conditional
	Using modal in conditional or "would"
Past simple
	Verb in the past
Past perfect
	"had" + past participal
Past progressive
	"was" or "were" + verb + "ing"
Past passive
	"was" pr "were" + past participal
Past conditional
	Present conditional with the present perfect
Future simple
	Using "will"
Passive conditional
	If we have "be"+past participal preceded by conditional 


 * Concatenate prepositions
Some prepositions are composed of several words; it is putting them together with "+" instead of space.
Utterance: "The bottle is next to the table in front of the kitchen."
	"The bottle is next+to the table in+front+of the kitchen."

In verbalization, "+" seront removed and replaced by spaces.


 * Agent complement
In a passive sentence form, we have an inversion between the subject and direct object. We have an additional officer who is preceded by "by", we shall be considered as an adverbial and so we will put it at the i_cmpl.
Utterance: "the code is written by me."


 * Conjunction
This variable tells us the conjunction that precedes the noun. By default we have chosen to put "AND". For the first nominal group, this variable has no effect (if it is "AND"). This variable can be also: "OR" and "BUT".
Where is the conjunction of adjectives or determinants, we have duplicated the nominal group to extend the conjunction of all the noun in question.
Utterance1: "You'd like the blue bottle or the glass?"
Utterance2: "The green or blue bottle is on the table."
	"The green bottle or the blue bottle is on the table."
Utterance3: "Give me two or three bottles."
	"Give me two bottles or three bottles."

We can thus have several nominal groups with different conjunctions
Example: I'll play a guitar or a piano and a violon.


 * recovery the adverb linken to the verb
We may be facing a particular case. In fact, the adverb may be the end of sentences. It is therefore imperative to recover.
Utterance: "Take the bottle carefully."
	Vrb_adv=['carefully']



=== Parsing ===

 * Data type
Once the preprocessing ends the first processing, phrases obtained by passing a function that makes them pass according to the type of different modules that depend on the shape of the sentence must be treated.
This classification is done using a list that contains the words with which we can usually start a sentence.
Example1: "is the bottle of my brother in your right?"
	Using auxiliary, it is an yes or no question
Example2: "good afternoon"
	Using good or hello/hi, it is start dialog 
Example3: "no."//"Sorry."
	It is disagreeing
Example3: "OK"
	It is agreeing

In the event that we have under interrogative, the sentence is a w question. The classification will therefore be the subject of the question. Examples :
When must you take the bus ? => date
Where is Broyen ? => place
Where must Jido and you be from ? => origin
Why should she go to Toulouse ? => reason
Who could you talk to on the phone ? => people
Whose blue bottle and red glass are these ? => owner
To whom are you talking ? => people
Which salesperson's competition won the award which we won in the last years ? => choice

For questions constructed with "what" can be processed differently. Indeed, for the issues that concern objects or conditions reported directly after "what" returns aims as examples:
What time is the news on TV? ? time
What size do you wear? ? size
Otherwise we proceed as for other w questions. However, we have to meet certain conditions:
If verb = "happen" ? => situation
If verb = "like" + tense is not conditional ? => description
If verb = "go" + first i_compl ends with "ing" ? => explication
If verb = "think" ? => opinion
Else for all other cases it is ? => thing
It the case when we have "what kind" or "what type" ? classification + object of the question. The processing of the issue is as for other w questions from the position of the object.
Utterance: "What type of people doesn't read this magazine? What kind of music must he listen to everyday? What kind of sport is your favorite?"
	We will have aim: classification+people, classification+music and classification+sport. The analysis is applied on "don't read this magazine?", "must he listen to everyday?" and "is your favorite?"

For questions constructed with "how" can have a different processing. En Indeed, in matters concerning objects or conditions reported directly after "how", we have a similarity with "what questions". Examples:
How old are you? ? => old
How long is your uncle's store opened tonight ? => long
How far is it from the hotel to the restaurant? ? => far 
How soon can you be here? ? => soon
How often does Jido go skiing? ? => often
How mush ou How many ? => quantity
How about going ? => invitation
Otherwise we proceed as for other w questions. However, we have to meet certain conditions:
If verb = "like" ? => opinion
Else for all other cases it is ? => manner


 * Upper case process 
We can start sentences with capital letters or not. But when an imperative sentence, the verb must be known beforehand in a list if not implemented in the program must have recourse to a lowercase.


 * Numbers
The numbers are determinants. For compound numbers, we created a function that concatenates with "+".
Utterance: "I take twenty two bottles."
	"I take twenty+two bottles."


 * State verb
In the case of a verb of state, we note the absence of a direct object as opposed to adverbial. We have therefore chosen to use the variable d_obj to convey information related to adjectives.
Utterance: "The bottle is on the table. The bottle is blue. The bottle is Blue."
	For the first sentence, it is an adverbial
	In the second, we have an adjective. We create, on the level  of d_obj, a NominalGroup contained that adjective
	In the third sentence, we have a proper name (any word in uppercase is considered a proper name) and so we use the d_obj


 * Punctuation
We detect the end of the sentence in an utterance with punctuation. At the end of the utterance, case of forgotten, the program automatically adds a declarative. Points can be attached or separated from the word that precedes.
All commas arriving at the end of the treatment of preprocessing (no transformation), we delete it because it will not serve us.


 * Adverbial case:
Normally a user must define the adverbial by 2 commas. The first, which is normally before the proposal will be removed(So the user can omit). The second is at the end, is not essential if it is the end of the sentence. The program will automatically add the semicolon that marks the end of the conditional sentence is the end (in the case described above) or in place of the comma. 
Utterance: "the man, who talks, has a new car. I play the guitar that I bought yesterday."
	"the man who talks; has a new car. I play the guitar that I bought yesterday;."

In the case when we have many adverbilas in the sentence, it is necessary to put as many commas as there are bounding adverbials.
Utterance1: "The bottle that I bought from the store which is in the shopping center, , is yours."
	"The bottle that I bought from the store which is in the shopping center; ; is yours."
Utterance2: "The bottle that I bought from the store which is in the shopping center, is yours."
	"The bottle that I bought from the store which is in the shopping center; is yours;." It is false.


 * Adjectives
All lists of adjectives with commas and "and", they will be removed.
Utterance: "The bottle is blue, big and fanny."
	"The bottle is blue big fanny."
 

 * Modal
To do this we used a list of all the modal form they are simple or conditional.
The processing (for tense or other) will change if there is a modal in the sentence. The modal is used in its present form in the sentence with the main verb in vrb_main.
Example: "You shouldn't drive his poorest uncle's wife's big new car. Should I give you the bottle? Shall I go?"
	We will have vrb_main=['should+drive'], vrb_main=['should+give'] and vrb_main=['shall+go'].


 * Duality between direct and indirect complement
In processing, we distinguish a direct object with the absence of preposition. Otherwise, the nominal group and will be found at the i_cmpl.
Example: I give it to you	
_ direct object
_ indirect object
It is possible to have two groups with no nominal preposition and are not bound by "and". In this case, the first noun that is being d_obj will be copied i_cmpl for the second noun takes its place. In fact in every sentence there a single direct object
Example: give me the bottle
_ direct object
_ indirect object


 * Adverbial
An adverbial is a sentence; it should be treated as such. The problem is to find its starting point and end point. For starting, every adverbial have to start with a proposition. Regarding the end, we used a semicolon (see punctuation).
By combining the functions that deal "and" and adding the semicolons, so we can analyze sentences such as:
Utterance: "don't quickly give me the bottle which is on the table, and the glass which I cleaned yesterday, at my left."

For adverbials nested, we have to process the principal adverbial like a sentence and other adverbials will be processed recursively. During preprocessing, we encountered a problem with commas (see punctuation)


 * Conditional sentence
If the reply begins with "if", it is a case treated in classifying sentences. But if "if" is in the middle (at the second part of the conditional sentence), we analyze it as a regular subject.
Utterance1: "If you do your job, you will be happy."
Utterance2: "You will be happy if you do your job."


 * Duality between nominal group and the conjunctive adverbial
"that" can be used as a determinant for a noun, as a proposal for an adverbial conjonction. The differentiation was made, because "that" of the conjonction is necessarily followed by a noun (the subject) conjunctive and phrase must be preceded by the verb or a pronoun as "me"
Utterance1: "Learn that I want you to give me the blue bottle." 
Utterance2: "Give me that bottle."
Utterance3: "Learn that I want you to give me the blue bottle that is blue."


 * Relative
The relative removes the redundancy through the proposal. If the latter replaces the subject, there is no problem. Otherwise it is necessary to recreate the redundancy to keep track of information sent. 
Utterance: "I take that bottle that I drink in."
	"I take that bottle that I drink in that bottle."


 * Duality between w question and adverbial
Some adverbial have a similar proposal after questioning, so it is important to put at the end of sentence.
Example: "when you come, I give you the bottle." ? mistake
Example: "I give you the bottle when you come." ? OK


 * Duality between adverbial "But" and "But"
At this stage of the project, we could not differentiate "but" between two nominal groups or one that represents a proposal of an adverbial. Hence we decided to put ":" before the first "but" to process it.
Example: "The bottle is not blue but it is red."
Example: "It is not the glass :but the bottle."


 * Force question 
A sentence may appear in a declarative but ends with a question mark. In this case, we force the query and retrieve a yes or no question in the stade of statement.
Utterance: "Mahdi is gonna the Laas?"



 * Demostrative pronoun
In English, we have some demonstrative pronouns can be used as such or as as determinants. We have therefore reduced their scope of use. Indeed, a demonstrative pronoun can not be followed by the verb of state "be".
Example1: this is a bottle
Example2: there is a bottle on the table
Example3: this bottle is blue
Example4: this goes to the cinema 
	The fourth example generates a mistake


 * Déterminants and quantifier
Normally a noun is detected by its determinant. If we have a plural at the beginning of a sentence or after a verb, we can detect. In fact the first case, we must be a verb that does not end with "s" So it is a noun or a proper name (For this case, we chose the noun plural). For the latter, as we get the rest of the sentence directly after analysis of tense, with the presence of the plural, we can identify the direct object.
Example : "bananas are fruits."

As regards quantification, we followed these rules:
a/an ? SOME
the+pluriel ? => ALL
vide+pluriel ? => ALL
no ? => NONE
no+pluriel ? => ANY
any ? => ANY
those/these ? => SOME
there+are ? => SOME
every ? => ALL
anything ? => ALL
something ? => SOME
some ? => SOME
sinon ? => ONE


 * Interjunction
It finished the interjection with an exclamation point. Where we with a comma, we must know if the list of noun is the subject or not. To do this we must detect "and" knowing that after the last noun there is no comma.
Example: "He Patrick, the bottle is on the table. Give it to me"
Example: "Jido, give me the bottle. Jido, Patrick and you will go to the cinema. " 
Example: "Jido, Patrick and you, give me the bottle"

If we note the presence of an interjection, and in the following sentences in the utterance are imperative, there must be the noun of the interjection in the subject in sentences.



=== Verbalise ===

 * Type de phrases
Thanks to data_type, we can pass them to functions that can reconstruct sentences. Following the same rules stated in the above. Except in respect of question with aim as "people" are always built with "who". For "how mush" and "haw many", we will have "how mush". "what kind" and "what type", we will have "what kind".
